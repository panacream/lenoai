## Introduction

Leno AI is designed to help you understand and implement AI agents in a structured way. With its modular architecture, you can easily customize and extend the framework to suit your needs. This project aims to make AI accessible to students, educators, and anyone interested in learning about multi-agent systems.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Supports multiple agents that can work together or independently.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Built to run on Node.js, Python 3, and can be deployed on Google Cloud.
- **Educational Focus**: Includes documentation and examples aimed at learners.
- **Community-Driven**: Open-source contributions are welcome to enhance the framework.

## Getting Started
